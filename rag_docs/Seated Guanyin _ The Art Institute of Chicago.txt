ABOUT THIS ARTWORK

Guanyin is the Bodhisattva of Compassion, one of the most beloved Chinese Buddhist deities. He can be identified by the small figure of Amituo (Amitabha), Buddha of the Western Paradise, in his headdress. His pose—seated with one leg hanging and his right arm resting on the other knee—further distinguishes him as Guanyin of the Southern Sea, a reference to the deity’s island home. The figure’s gentle expression makes an emotional appeal to the viewer, which is typical of Chinese sculpture from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The carving was originally painted with intricately patterned robes and traces of color are still visible on his back. Later—probably during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644)—the wood was covered entirely with gold.
